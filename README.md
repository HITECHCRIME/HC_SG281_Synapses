## Lyrics

```
wreckin rough draughts 
as a morbid turnaround aye
first blink of an eye 
and bet you gonna die yeah

chains on my hands 
announcing my demise
pulling on'em short 
finna gonna ride ya

finna gonna ride the thermals up
finna burn the rust eternal 
and that's what's up - ey
up your mind into the brain's synapse
synapses made my way to the top

i worked for years 
spinning round the clock


will of the feral's ????????????

xxxxx
xxxxx

depth strida valley

```
